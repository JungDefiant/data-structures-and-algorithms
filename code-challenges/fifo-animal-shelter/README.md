# Animal Shelter
This program creates an animal shelter

## Challenge
This challenge is to create an animal shelter that queues cat and dog objects, then dequeues an animal depending on a preference given.

## Approach & Efficiency
Unit tests for each functionality for the data structure were created. After 'mapping out' the desired outcomes through unit tests, each function was made. Time complexities for methods are as follows.

* Enqueue() -> O(1) since the operation is performed once
* Dequeue() -> O(1) since the operation is performed once

## API
Public methods include:

* Enqueue() -> Adds an animal to the "front" of the animal shelter.
