# Multi-Bracket Validation
This program validates incoming strings with multiple brackets

## Challenge
This challenge is to create a function that validates whether a string with brackets has 'complete sets'

## Approach & Efficiency
Unit tests for the method were created. After 'mapping out' the desired outcomes through unit tests, each function was made. Time complexity for the method is O(n), since the input string is iterated over only once.

## API
Public methods include:

* MultiBracketValidation(string input) -> Takes a string and returns true or false, depending on if all brackets in the string have opening and closing sets
