# Insertion Sort
This program sorts an array of integers using insertion sort.

## Challenge
This challenge is to create a C# class that sorts an array of integers using insertion sort.

## Approach
Unit tests for the method were created. After 'mapping out' the desired outcomes through unit tests, each function was made.

- InsertionSort.SortIntArray --> Performs insertion sort on an array of integers
- InsertionSort.CheckSortedIntArray --> Checks whether array is sorted
