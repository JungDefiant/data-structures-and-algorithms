# Merge Sort
This program sorts an array of integers using merge sort.

## Challenge
This challenge is to create a C# class that sorts an array of integers using merge sort.

## Approach
Unit tests for the method were created. After 'mapping out' the desired outcomes through unit tests, each function was made.

- MergeSort.DoMergeSort --> Separates an array into two halves, recursively merge sorts each array, then merges the remaining array
- MergeSort.Merge --> Merges two arrays into another array
