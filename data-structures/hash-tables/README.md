# Hash Tables
This program creates a hashtable.

## Challenge
This challenge is to create a C# class that creates a hashtable data structure.

## Approach
Unit tests for the method were created. After 'mapping out' the desired outcomes through unit tests, each function was made.

- MergeSort.DoMergeSort --> Separates an array into two halves, recursively merge sorts each array, then merges the remaining array
- MergeSort.Merge --> Merges two arrays into another array
